MaptimeSEA is the Seattle branch of the international [Maptime](http://maptime.io) community. Together, we learn and explore mapping technologies through tutorials and other meetups. We organize and teach under these major principles:

1. **No Map Left Behind**. You will never leave a meeting without completing the tutorial at hand. We try our best to make no assumptions of prior knowledge when introducing new technologies.
1. **Free**. All of our meetings are free.
1. **Powered by interest**. We teach what people want to learn. Our curriculum is ever-evolving and intended to focus on what's newest and most prevalent to *right now*.

#Stay Connected

**Meetup**. All of our meetings and events will be posted on [our meetup site](http://meetup.com/maptimeSEA). Here you can RSVP for upcoming meetings and ask questions of your fellow mappers.

**Twitter**. We also have a twitter account [@MaptimeSEA](http://twitter.com/MaptimeSEA) where you can follow our every move. Say hello to us!

**Email**. Questions? Send us an email at `maptimesea@gmail.com` to get in touch.

**Survey**. Our tutorials are structured around what you want to learn. Fill out our survey out even if you haven't attended a meeting to express what you're interested in learning! [bit.ly/maptimesea_survey](http://bit.ly/maptimesea_survey)

#Our Tutorials

We are trying our best to post tutorials so anybody can learn from them. We'll be using [resources](http://maptime.io/lessons-resources/) from [MaptimeHQ](http://twitter.com/MaptimeHQ) as well as writing our own, which can be [viewed on the website](http://maptimesea.github.io/).
