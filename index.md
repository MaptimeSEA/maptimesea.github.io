MaptimeSEA is the Seattle branch of the international Maptime community. Together, we learn and explore mapping technologies through tutorials and other meetups. We organize and teach under these major principles:

1. **No Map Left Behind**. You will never leave a meeting without completing the tutorial at hand. We try our best to make no assumptions of prior knowledge when introducing new technologies.
1. **Free**. All of our meetings are free.
1. **Powered by interest**. We teach what people want to learn. Our curriculum is ever-evolving and intended to focus on what's newest and most prevalent to *right now*.

MaptimeSEA has a [Code of Conduct](/conduct/) for all our activities.  Please read it.
