# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct governs how we behave in any MaptimeSEA forum or event and whenever we will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honored by everyone who participates in the MaptimeSEA community as an organizer, speaker, attendee, or in any other way. It applies to in-person events (such as workshops and social events), chat services, social media, and any other forums which the community uses for communication and interactions.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, so that it can enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

## Consequences

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, MaptimeSEA organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or immediate expulsion from the community and community events.

## If You are Witness or Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a MaptimeSEA organizer as soon as possible: maptimesea [at] gmail [dot] com.

## Diversity Statement

At MaptimeSEA, we are committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and respectful community. We stand firmly against any form of discrimination, harassment, or exclusion, including factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, age, disability, and more.

We actively seek to create a space free from derogatory comments and harmful actions. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining, and we will always work to treat everyone well. No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. 

## Specific Guidelines

### We strive to:

Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient.
We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Note that we have a multi-cultural, multi-lingual community and some of us are non-native speakers. We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community.

### Be inquisitive.

Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving MaptimeSEA.

### Be careful in the words that we choose.

We value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult, put down, or heckle other participants, organizers, or speakers. We are all here to learn and be a part of an awesome mapping community, so please be respectful!

Harassment and other exclusionary behaviors are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Personal insults or discriminatory jokes and language, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
- Offensive comments, excessive or unnecessary profanity.
- Intimidation, violent threats or demands.
- Disruption of sessions or events.
- Stalking, harassing photography or recording.
- Unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention.
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
- Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
