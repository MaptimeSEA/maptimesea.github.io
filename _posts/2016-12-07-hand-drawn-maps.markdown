We are setting aside the digital tools for a session. This is all about making art and having fun. Hand drawn maps are an excellent way to think differently about geography, and open a world of opportunity when it comes to creativity and design.

In this, our second annual Hand Drawn Maps session, our goal was to give everyone an opportunity to collaborate on a single project, but also make space for anyone to work on their own project. We've found some inspiration in [Danielle Dai's hand-drawn-maps repository](https://github.com/ddai/hand-drawn-maps) on Github.

Our wonderful guest instructor Matt Stevenson brought a few art supplies (colored pencils, sketching paper, water colors, sharpies, and lots of paper) but asked people to bring their own supplies in order to have enough for everyone. *Note: people were very willing to bring their own supplies, so it worked out fine!* We also had chocolate and holiday music playing in the background.

Below are the group project we worked on:

# Hand drawn grid

The group project involved taking a map of Seattle and breaking it up into a grid, with enough cells for each individual coming to the meetup.

The goal is to have everyone choose a cell and draw that part of the grid using whatever tools and supplies they wanted and combine them at the end. Everyone chose a grid to their liking and took off - the project as a whole took about **1.5 hours**. Here is the final product, with some close-ups:
