In honor of May being Missing Maps month, we hosted a Humanitarian Open Street Map Mapathon.

We were lucky enough to be joined by people from the local Missing Maps chapter. We all worked on the HOT OSM task 1789, in Western Swaziland. We focused on mapping just buildings, making them nice and clean using the auto-square option, and tagging them appropriately. You can find the slides [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9K68TCuaX4ebU5rdVlyT3JJSVZxclZtemxCdF9QWEtralI0/view?usp=sharing).

### Best Practices:

1. Just map buildings (at least that was what our HOT area instructed)
2. If you don't know if its a building, map it anyway because its easier for QC people to remove erroneous data than to add missing data
3. Use the quick square and quick circle options to make the shapes better
4. Save work frequently
5. Be sure to tag data (if its a building, tag it as a building)
