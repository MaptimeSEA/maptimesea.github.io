In honor of May being Missing Maps month, we hosted a [Humanitarian Open Street Map](https://hotosm.org/) Mapathon!

We were led by the great folks at the local Missing Maps chapter. They provided a [tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9K68TCuaX4ebU5rdVlyT3JJSVZxclZtemxCdF9QWEtralI0/view?usp=sharing) on getting started and then we mapped the night away. We all worked on the HOT OSM task 1789, in Western Swaziland. Check out pictures of our event [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/maptime/sets/72157668173054552)!

### Best Practices:

1. Just map buildings (at least that was what our HOT area instructed)
2. If you don't know if its a building, map it anyway because its easier for QC people to remove erroneous data than to add missing data
3. Use the quick square and quick circle options to make the shapes better
4. Save work frequently
5. Be sure to tag data (if its a building, tag it as a building)
