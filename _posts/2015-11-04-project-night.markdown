In this session [Christy](http://christyheaton.github.io/) gave a [quick introduction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YQClDdqfgHp5_sz-06fckN-720ts4n7VW0BmJreNcUs/edit?usp=sharing), then everyone worked on their own projects or worked in a group.

Folks did anything from installing software, to working on a [tutorial](http://maptimesea.github.io/), to reformatting a work project.
