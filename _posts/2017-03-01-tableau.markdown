# About Tableau

Tableau is a data visualization program.

Example: [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/blog/data-center)

Example: [Brexit](https://public.tableau.com/profile/solbrigm#!/vizhome/BrexitResults/EUReferendumResults)

Example: [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/solbrigm#!/vizhome/kagglehousing/DashboardAction)

## Interacting with Tableau
1. Download workbook from [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/solbrigm#!/vizhome/kagglehousing/DashboardAction)
2. Open Workbook in Tableau Public
3. Pause for defintions:
    * Marks Card: Chart type
    * Show Me
    * Shelfs: Rows, Columns, Color, Size

### Challenge 1
The Price by ZipCode sheet is not very good currently. Can you make it better?

## More Interacting
* Filters
* Filter Formating
* Pages Shelf

## Dashboards
* Basic Dashboard creation
* Dashboard Filter
* Filter controls

### Challenge 2
Add filters and dashboard actions to the Price Distibution dash to find the price distribution of 1-3 bedroom, 1-2 bathroom in south side of Seattle

## Dashboards2
* Dashboard actions Dialog

### Challenge 3
* The Cost per sqft Dash tries to show how the cost per sqft changes depending on zip code. However, whenever it filters the data below, it is very jolting. Use the Dashboard > Actions menu to create a highlight action instead of a filter action.

## Calculated Fields
* Analysis > Create Calculated Field
* Parameters

### Challenge 4
* It would be much better if the zip codes were colored by average cost per sq ft, to make a more unified message. Create a calculated field to compute price per sqft, and color the map using that instead. Advanced: Also create a new sheet that displays the price per sqft, and create a filter action from the Map to the new sheet so that it displays the correct value for a selected zipcode.

# Part 2: Mapping Specifically

## Geographic Field Types

* Automatically Recognized Fields: City, County, State
* Not Recognized: Metro
* Edit Locations, 'Ambiguous'
* Geographic Hierarchies (Geometry Field)

### Challenge 5
* Create a State > Country > City hierarchy on the Zillow data.
* Create a map of their Geometries, and filter down to just Seattle Neighborhoods


## Aggregate Geometries???
* Add Size Rank to the color shelf... Why is it all just one color?
* Custom Territories
