title: "Design your own web maps with Leaflet!"

In this session, [Garland Potts] (https://twitter.com/sgpotts) taught us how the [Seattle Times] (http://www.seattletimes.com/) uses Leaflet to make beautiful maps for their stories.

We went through a [lesson and demonstration] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wpcg20D9go0qq4bwdBjPMHGK_66nqTaIB8iFPVH98H0/edit?usp=sharing), then made our own maps using data we made using http://geojson.io/.

Check out the [Leaflet website] (http://leafletjs.com/) for some great information and tutorials.

Huge thanks to [Garland Potts] (https://twitter.com/sgpotts) for teaching this lesson!
