## Welcome to Maptime Seattle!

[Maptime](http://maptime.io/) is a community dedicated to teaching and learning all things geospatial. Maptime offers local mappers the opportunity to learn cutting-edge geospatial technologies.

Maptime's mission is :
```
"to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone
interested by creating a time and space for collaborative
learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools
and technologies."
```

## Introduction
This week we will dive into the basics of GIS. Checkout the slide deck [here](/img/IntroToGIS_MaptimeSea_20170906.pdf).

## Workshop

You can find the data needed for this workshop [here](https://github.com/christyheaton/MaptimeSea_092017).

**Together we will:**
* Open [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). I recommend the latest (eg for new users) 64-bit version for your operating system.
* Load [data](https://github.com/christyheaton/MaptimeSea_092017) related to the 2017 Total Solar Eclipse.
* Learn how to find projections, change layer styles, and layer control operations.
* Install the OpenLayers plugin to get access to awesome basemaps.
* Reproject data to get it ready for processing.
* Identify cities in the eclipse's path of totality using the clip tool.
